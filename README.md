<p class="text-justify">Taking the first image on the left as an example, what do you see at your first glance? A painting of a path through a forest (zoom
in for a detailed look), or a human face (zoom out for a more global view)? Based on the off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model,
we contribute a plug-and-play method that naturally dissolves a reference image (shown in the bottom-right corner) into arbitrary scenes
described by a text prompt, providing a free lunch for synthesizing optical illusion hidden pictures using diffusion model. Better viewed with zoom-in.</p>
